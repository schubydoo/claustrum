# Changelog

All notable changes to claustrum are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once it reaches 1.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial clean-room daemon: JSON-RPC 2.0 over `AF_UNIX`, 18 methods
  (`server.*`, `files.*`, `git.*`, `process.*`), in-band token auth, per-process
  replay buffer with `reattach`.
- Modes: `-serve` (self-daemonizing RPC server), `-bridge` (stdio↔socket relay),
  `-stop`, `-version`, `-install` (CLI download/verify/extract/prune).
- Cross-platform builds for linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64 (`make all`).
- Docs: `README`, `docs/PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/EXAMPLES.md`,
  `docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md`, `docs/UPSTREAM-TRACKING.md`.
- `scripts/check-upstream.sh` — drift detection against a reference build SHA.
- Unit tests (`*_test.go`) covering the wire surface: byte-exact frame encoding,
  JSON-RPC dispatch/auth/error routing, the per-process replay buffer, and env
  merging — run under the race detector in CI.
- Apache-2.0 license; independence & trademark `NOTICE`.
