"""Insert a ``[Compare with <prev>]`` link under the newest CHANGELOG heading.

knope owns the changelog version heading and writes it as a plain ``## X.Y.Z (date)``
line with no diff link (knope has no template for the heading itself, and a linked
``## [X.Y.Z](url)`` heading is one knope no longer recognizes as a release).

claustrum's changelog (inherited from release-please) puts a compare link with each
release, so this script keeps that convention: it runs as a Command step right after
``PrepareRelease`` (see ``knope.toml``), finds the newest version section knope just
wrote, and inserts

    [Compare with <prev>](<REPO>/compare/v<prev>...v<version>)

on its own line *under* the heading, where knope preserves it untouched. Idempotent
(a second run is a no-op) and a no-op for the very first release (no predecessor). The
``v<version>`` tag doesn't exist until the release publishes -- that's fine, it
resolves once the tag is pushed, exactly as release-please's links did.

Usage: ``changelog_compare_link.py <version> [changelog_path]`` (knope passes ``$version``).
Exits non-zero if the changelog shape is unexpected -- fail loud, never ship a wrong link.
Stdlib only.
